Description: Schemacrawler (http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/)
 Schemacrawler (http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/) is a free database schema
 discovery and comprehension tool.
 
 SchemaCrawler has a good mix useful features for data governance. You can search
 for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the schema
 and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database
 documentation, and is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas.
 
 SchemaCrawler also generates schema diagrams (and hence depends on graphviz).
 
 You can execute scripts in any standard scripting language against your database.
 
 You can find potential schema design issues with lint.
