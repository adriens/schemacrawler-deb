How-to Guide

This distribution of SchemaCrawler is NOT bundled with a database driver, BUT 
does not require you to download any other SchemaCrawler distributions. Please
download the JDBC driver for your database, and place the jar file in the lib folder. 

All the SchemaCrawler integrations, that is, integrations for JavaScript, 
Velocity, FreeMarker, and graphing are available. However, the jars files for 
these third-party libraries are not provided. You can download the libraries 
that you want to use from their respective websites, and place them in the lib 
folder of the SchemaCrawler distribution. Any jar files in the SchemaCrawler lib 
folder will be used automatically.
